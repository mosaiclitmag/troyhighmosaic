This is the official code/website for the Troy High Mosaic, written by creative director Gyro H. in 2024. If you use this for a future Litmag, please, feel free to tweak it to your heart's desire. However, *please* know some HTML & CSS before touching this stuff. I suggest you take to https://www.w3schools.com/ and https://stackoverflow.com/ as well as looking up what you need help with. The page was created with Visual Studio Code, a free code editior for just about every coding language, and hosted with Cloudflare pages. Learn, explore, make some copies so you don't lose anything, and please don't forget to ask for help and do your own research.
